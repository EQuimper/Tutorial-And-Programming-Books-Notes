# Tutorial & Programming Books

This is a list of programming books & Tutorial I (read || watch) or want to (read || watch). I also put here all the notes I got from them. This list was start in Feb 2018. So for the book I (read || watch) before, I'm gonna re-(read || watch) them quickly and wrote notes.

## Why do this ?

Why not ?

Want to improve myself as a programmer, and writing notes, in same time as reading or doing a tutorial is one of the best way to keep it. Also this way I can re-read my notes when I'm searching about what I read before.
