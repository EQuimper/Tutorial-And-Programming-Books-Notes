# Meaningful Names

### Use Intention-Revealing Names

- Choosing good names take time but daves more than it takes.
- Change them when you find better ones.
- Name should answer all the big questions.
  - Why it exists?
  - What it does ?
  - How it is used
- If name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal it's indent

### Avoid disinformation

Dont use name who mean more than one thing, like hp etc. Don't use the name `accountList` unless it's actually a `List`. Cause list mean something in programming. Replace that with `accountGroup` `bunchOfAccounts` or just plain `accounts`

### Make Meaningful Distinctions

We have a `Product` class, if we have another called `ProductInfo` or `ProductData` we made the names different without making them mean anything different. `Info` or `Data` are indisting noise.

Noise words are redundant, the word variable should never appear in a variable, like table in a tablename.

### Use Pronounceable Names

Can't pronounce it ? Dont use it.

### Use searchable Names
